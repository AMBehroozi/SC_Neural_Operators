# Sensitivity-Constrained Fourier Neural Operators (SC-FNO)

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of **Sensitivity-Constrained Fourier Neural Operators (SC-FNO)**, a novel approach to improve neural operators for parametric differential equations of the form \(\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = f(u, x, t, p)\). SC-FNO enhances the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) by addressing challenges in inverse problems, sensitivity calculations (\(\frac{\partial u}{\partial p}\)), and concept drift using a sensitivity loss regularizer. It outperforms standard FNO and FNO with PINN regularization, offering superior accuracy in solution paths and parameter inversion, scalability (tested up to 82 parameters), and reduced training demands.

## Key Features
- High accuracy in forward and inverse problems
- Robustness to sparse data and complex parameter spaces
- Reduced training time and data requirements
- Applicable to various differential equations and neural operators
