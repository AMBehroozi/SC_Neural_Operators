# Fourier Neural Operators for Flood Simulation

## Overview

This private repository is dedicated to investigating the application of Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) and incorporating physics constraints into FNO for the purpose of flood simulation. Our primary focus is on solving the shallow water equations, a fundamental component in understanding and predicting flood dynamics.

## Objectives

- **Exploration of FNO**: Investigate the capabilities and limitations of Fourier Neural Operators in the context of fluid dynamics and flood prediction.

- **Physics-Constrained FNO**: Enhance FNO models with physics-based constraints to improve accuracy and reliability in flood simulation.

- **Shallow Water Equations**: Utilize the shallow water equations as a testbed for FNO models, aiming to solve these equations under various conditions to simulate flood scenarios.

## Background

Fourier Neural Operators offer a promising framework for learning operators directly in Fourier space, enabling the efficient handling of partial differential equations (PDEs) that govern fluid dynamics and other physical processes. By integrating physics-based constraints, we aim to leverage the inherent laws of physics to guide the learning process, thereby improving the model's performance and interpretability.
